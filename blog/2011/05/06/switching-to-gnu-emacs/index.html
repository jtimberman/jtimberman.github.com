<div class="entry-content"><p>I have a confession to make.</p>
<p>For those who follow me on <a href="http://twitter.com/jtimberman" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, you already know. For those who read the title of this post, you can make an educated guess.</p>
<p>After ~16 years of using Vi/Vim/MacVim, I&#8217;m switching my primary editor to Emacs. Over the years, I have tried to use Emacs without much progress. I never really gave enough effort to learn it. In fact, only in the last year did I learn all the movement keys (C-f, C-b, C-n, C-p). To say I made uneducated disparaging comments about Emacs would be an understatement.</p>
<p>I have a highly customized Vim/MacVim setup, with lots of bells and whistles like NERDtree, Command-T, language plugins <a href="https://github.com/jtimberman/dotvim" target="_blank">and more</a>&nbsp;derived from Adam Jacob&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/adamhjk/adam-vim" target="_blank">repository</a>. I&#8217;ve spent countless hours tweaking and customizing it further to enhance productivity.</p>
<p>So how did I come around and completely switch editors? It wasn&#8217;t easy, that&#8217;s for sure. First there&#8217;s the resistance to a new tool. However, I wanted to keep a truly open mind, and give it a real, honest attempt. I bought the <a href="http://amzn.com/0596006489" target="_blank">O&#8217;Reilly Learning GNU Emacs</a> book and started reading, with the editor open to one of my favorite things to edit, my ~/chef-repo.</p>
<p>Actually the first thing I did was get a sensible and sane configuration started. I forked Phil Hagelberg&#8217;s excellent&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/technomancy/emacs-starter-kit">Emacs Starter Kit</a>. I also thought AquaMacs would be the sensible place to start, since I&#8217;m using a Mac, and it uses a lot of familiar OS X hotkeys for copy/paste, opening and closing tabs and more. However, some fellow Opscode coworkers advised against AquaMacs, especially with the starter kit, because it leads one down a path of really &#8220;non-standard&#8221; Emacs settings. That isn&#8217;t entirely awful, since I manage my <a href="jtimberman.posterous.com/managing-my-workstations-with-chef" target="_blank">workstation(s) with Chef</a> and have my Emacs config available first thing on a new machine (now that its added in, anyway :)). However, I quickly became annoyed with some erratic behavior. For example, opening a tab, then having something like a completion window means that switching tabs will keep the completion window persisted, even though it was split on &#8220;a different tab&#8221;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I switched to GNU Emacs, and have been using that for the last week. I have no measure of whether my productivity is increased or not, but I&#8217;m getting pretty comfortable with the editor, and able to do most of what I was really good at in Vim. I sometimes miss Command-T, but the default Emacs file fine (C-x C-f for those that don&#8217;t know) is really good. Some of the things that I have found to be totally essential and are what keep me using the editor:</p>
<p>Buffers are totally sane, very fast to switch between, and easy to navigate between open files. Also related, the half hour or so I spent learning and practising the basics - create horizontal and veritical split, opening files in new windows, and more was totally worth it. I&#8217;m actually getting to be faster than the panels used in Vim, which I&#8217;ve been using for ~4 years.</p>
<p>File navigation is awesome. I really liked &#8221;<img src="http://km.support.apple.com/library/APPLE/APPLECARE_ALLGEOS/HT1343/ks_command.gif" alt="" />-T&#8221; in the short time I used TextMate, and I loved <a href="http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2008/10/10/coming-home-to-vim" target="_blank">FuzzyFileFinder</a> and <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3025" target="_blank">Command-T plugins</a> for Vim. However the flexiblity of the built-in default file navigation in Emacs is really intuitive for me.</p>
<p>With the Emacs starter-kit, some good modes are installed and available by default without modification. Most of the time I&#8217;m using Ruby, Markdown or Javascript modes. I anticipate starting in on org-mode at some point, but as I&#8217;m still getting comfortable with the basics, we&#8217;ll take some baby steps :).</p>
<p>Emacs really is easy to customize. I never really did much with Vim. I certainly cargo culted other configs, went with what worked, and left it at that. With Emacs, I&#8217;m doing that, but the code I&#8217;m looking at is more sensible to me. I hope this doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;m going to go learn Lisp :). As I&#8217;ve forked emacs-starter-kit on GitHub, and made my own customizations, I&#8217;m also sharing those back on the site, so if you want to see what changes I&#8217;ve made and additional modes I&#8217;ve installed, <a href="https://github.com/jtimberman/emacs-starter-kit" target="_blank">take a peek</a>. If you look, there&#8217;s a chef.el the &#8220;jtimberman&#8221; directory with some shortcuts to drop off common Chef resources. As I learn more, I plan to make that a bit more useful as snippets or maybe even a chef-mode.</p>
<p>Speaking of custom modes, even if I didn&#8217;t use it for anything else, Emacs is totally worth using for confluence-mode. We have two Confluence wikis, one for Chef, and an internal company wiki. Confluence mode seems to assume you only have one wiki, and I haven&#8217;t sorted out the details on how to easily switch between the two. For now I just put the confluence-url setting in the *scratch* buffer and do M-x eval-region to &#8220;switch&#8221;. That said, the ability to quickly search for a page and load the confluence wiki markup page in a buffer, then save the content back out to the wiki directly is *awesome*. No more 4 step process to copy/paste the markup into an editor window and back out to the form. Also, while there&#8217;s a Vim syntax plugin for Confluence, I had no end of error trying to use it.</p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve only been using Emacs for a week, I&#8217;m still a novice. However, I&#8217;ve gotten to the point where I can get what I need done in writing Chef cookbooks and documentation. I&#8217;m enjoying the learning process, and pleased that I&#8217;m at a point where the editor is not only out of the way, but helping me get more done.</p>
<p>The potential to devolve into an editor war is high, so please, no comments about how other editors are better or that I should switch back to Vim. I firmly believe that everyone should use tools that they enjoy, and that help them be productive. Snarky comments can be made on twitter, of course :).</p>
