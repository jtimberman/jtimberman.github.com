    <id>http://jtimberman.housepub.org/blog/2013/05/03/tdd-cookbook-ticket</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post will briefly describe how I did a TDD update to Opscode&rsquo;s
<a href="http://ckbk.it/runit">runit</a> to resolve an
<a href="https://tickets.opscode.com/browse/COOK-2867">issue reported last night</a>.</p>

<p>First, the issue manifests itself only on Debian systems. The runit
cookbook&rsquo;s <code>runit_service</code> provider will write an
<a href="http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/COOK-1576">LSB init.d script</a> on
Debian, rather than symlinking to <code>/usr/bin/sv</code>. The problem raised in
the new ticket is that the template will follow the link and write to
<code>/usr/bin/sv</code>. This is bad, as it will end up in a forkbomb as
runsvdir attempts to restart sv on
<a href="http://drupal.org/files/x-all-the-things-template.png">all the things</a>.
Oops! Sorry about that. Let&rsquo;s get it fixed, and practice some TDD.</p>

<p>The runit cookbook includes support for test-kitchen, though I did
need to
<a href="https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/runit/commit/8d2e0fcb9d6becf99c0d30694164e57d59fb667b">update it</a>
for this effort. Part of this change was adding a box for Debian in
the <code>.kitchen.yml</code>. I set about resolving this with TDD in mind.</p>

<p>First, the runit cookbook includes a couple
<a href="https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/runit/tree/master/test/cookbooks">&ldquo;test&rdquo; cookbooks</a>
to facilitate setting up the system with the <code>runit_service</code> resource
so the outcome can be tested to ensure the behavior is correct. I
started by adding a &ldquo;failing test&rdquo; in the <code>runit_test::service</code>
recipe, meaning a link resource, and a <code>runit_service</code> resource that
would overwrite <code>/usr/bin/sv</code>.</p>

<p>```ruby
link &ldquo;/etc/init.d/cook-2867&rdquo; do
  to &ldquo;/usr/bin/sv&rdquo;
end</p>

<p>runit_service &ldquo;cook-2867&rdquo; do
  default_logger true
end
```</p>

<p>Then I ran <code>kitchen test</code> on the Debian box. As expected, the link was
created, and then the runit service was configured. The service&rsquo;s
provider will wait until the service is up. Since we&rsquo;ve destroyed the
sv binary, that will never happen, so I destroyed it. I manually
confirmed the behavior too, to make sure I wasn&rsquo;t seeing something
weird. Due to its very nature, this is <em>really</em> hard to test for
automatically, but it will happen consistently.</p>

<p>Next, I had to write the code to implement the fix for this bug.
Essentially, this means checking if the <code>/etc/init.d/cook-2867</code> file
is a symbolink link, and removing it.</p>

<p><code>ruby
initfile = ::File.join( '/etc', 'init.d', new_resource.service_name)
::File.unlink(initfile) if ::File.symlink?(initfile)
</code></p>

<p>Simple enough. Next I tested again by destroying the existing
environment and rerunning it from scratch. This takes some time, but
it verifies that everything is working properly. Here&rsquo;s the output on
Debian:</p>

<p><code>
INFO: Processing link[/etc/init.d/cook-2867] action create (runit_test::service line 147)
INFO: link[/etc/init.d/cook-2867] created
INFO: Processing service[cook-2867] action nothing (dynamically defined)

INFO: runit_service[cook-2867] configured
INFO: Chef Run complete in 7.267132764 seconds
INFO: Running report handlers
</code></p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t feel I needed a specific test for this in minitest-chef,
because it wouldn&rsquo;t have finished converging (earlier behavior I saw
in the &ldquo;failing&rdquo; test).</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re contributing to cookbooks, and they have support for
test-kitchen, it&rsquo;s awesome if you can open a bug report with a failing
test. In this case, it was fairly easy to reproduce the bug.</p>

    <link href="http://jtimberman.housepub.org/blog/2013/03/19/anatomy-of-a-test-kitchen-1-dot-0-cookbook-part-2/"/>
    <updated>2013-03-19T09:28:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://jtimberman.housepub.org/blog/2013/03/19/anatomy-of-a-test-kitchen-1-dot-0-cookbook-part-2</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>DISCLAIMER</strong> Test Kitchen 1.0 is still in <em>alpha</em> at the time of
  this post.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong> We&rsquo;re no longer required to use bundler, and in fact
  recommend installing the required RubyGems in your globalRuby
  environment (#3 below).</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong> The log output from the various kitchen commands is not
  updated with the latest and greatest. Play along at home, it&rsquo;ll be
  okay :&ndash;).</p>

<p>This is a continuation from <a href="/blog/2013/03/19/anatomy-of-a-test-kitchen-1-dot-0-cookbook-part-1/">part 1</a></p>

<p>In order to run the tests then, we need a few things on our machine:</p>

<ol>
<li>VirtualBox and Vagrant (1.1+)</li>
<li>A compiler toolchain with XML/XSLT development headers (for building Gem dependencies)</li>
<li>A sane, working Ruby environment (Ruby 1.9.3 or greater)</li>
<li>Git</li>
</ol>


<p>It is outside the scope of this post to cover how to get all those
installed.</p>

<p>Once those are installed:</p>

<p><code>
% vagrant plugin install vagrant-berkshelf
% gem install berkshelf
% gem install test-kitchen --pre
% gem install kitchen-vagrant
</code></p>

<p>Test Kitchen combines the suite (default) with the platform names
(e.g., ubuntu-12.04). To run all the suites on all platforms, simply do:</p>

<p><code>
% kitchen test
</code></p>

<p>This will take awhile, especially if you don&rsquo;t already have the
Vagrant boxes on your system, as it will download each one. To make
this faster, we&rsquo;ll just run Ubuntu 12.04:</p>

<p><code>
% kitchen test default.*1204
</code></p>

<p>Test Kitchen 1.0 can take a regular expression for the instances to
test. This will match the box <code>default-ubuntu-12.04</code>. I could also
just say <code>12</code> as that will match the single entry in my kitchen list
(above).</p>

<p>It will take a few minutes to run Test Kitchen. Those familiar with
Chef know that if it encounters an unhandled exception, it exits with
a non-zero return code. This is important, because we know at the end
of a successful run, Chef did the right thing, assuming our recipe is
the right thing :&ndash;).</p>

<p>To recap the <a href="/blog/2013/03/19/anatomy-of-a-test-kitchen-1-dot-0-cookbook-part-1/">previous post</a>, we have a run list like this:</p>

<p><code>
["recipe[apt]", "recipe[minitest-handler]", "recipe[bluepill_test]"]
</code></p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s break down the output of our successful run. I&rsquo;ll show the
output first, and explain it after:</p>

<p><code>
Starting Kitchen
Cleaning up any prior instances of &lt;default-ubuntu-1204&gt;
Destroying &lt;default-ubuntu-1204&gt;
Finished destroying &lt;default-ubuntu-1204&gt; (0m0.00s).
Testing &lt;default-ubuntu-1204&gt;
Creating &lt;default-ubuntu-1204&gt;
</code></p>

<p>This is basic setup to ensure that &ldquo;The Kitchen&rdquo; is clean beforehand
and we don&rsquo;t have existing state interfering with the run.</p>

<p><code>
[vagrant command] BEGIN (vagrant up default-ubuntu-1204 --no-provision)

[default-ubuntu-1204] Forwarding ports...
[default-ubuntu-1204] -- 22 =&gt; 2222 (adapter 1)
</code></p>

<p>This will look familiar to Vagrant users, we&rsquo;re just getting some
basic setup from Vagrant initializing the box defined in the
<code>.kitchen.yml</code> (passed to the Vagrantfile by the kitchen-vagrant
plugin). This step does a <code>vagrant up --no-provision</code>.</p>

<p><code>

</code></p>

<p>Remember from the <a href="/blog/2013/03/19/anatomy-of-a-test-kitchen-1-dot-0-cookbook-part-1/">previous post</a> that we&rsquo;re using Berkshelf? This is
the integration with Vagrant that ensures that the cookbooks are
available. The first four, <code>apt</code>, <code>yum</code>, <code>minitest-handler</code> and
bluepill_test are defined in the Berksfile. The next, <code>rsyslog</code> is a
dependency of the <code>bluepill</code> cookbook (for rsyslog integration), and the
last, <code>chef_handler</code> is a dependency of <code>minitest-handler</code>. Berkshelf
extracts the dependencies from the cookbook metadata of each cookbook
defined in the Berksfile.</p>

<p><code>

Vagrant instance &lt;default-ubuntu-1204&gt; created.
Finished creating &lt;default-ubuntu-1204&gt; (0m53.12s).
</code></p>

<p>Again, this is familiar output to Vagrant users, where Vagrant is
making the cookbooks available to the instance.</p>

<p><code>

[Berkshelf] Using chef_handler (1.1.0)
</code></p>

<p>This part is interesting, in that we&rsquo;re going to install the Full
Stack Chef (Omnibus) package. This means it doesn&rsquo;t matter what the
underlying base box has installed, we get the right version of Chef.
This is defined in the <code>.kitchen.yml</code>. This is done through <code>vagrant
ssh</code> (second line). Then, Test Kitchen does <code>vagrant provision</code>. The
provisioning step is where Berkshelf happens, so we do see this happen
again (perhaps a bug?).</p>

<p><code>

</code></p>

<p>This is the start of the actual Chef run, using Chef Solo by Vagrant&rsquo;s
provisioner. Note that we have our suite&rsquo;s run list. I&rsquo;m going to skip
a lot of the Chef output because it isn&rsquo;t required. Note that a few
resources in the minitest&mdash;handler will report as failed, but they can
be ignored because it means that those tests were simply not implemented.</p>

<p><code>

</code></p>

<p>These are the relevant parts of the minitest-handler recipe, where it
has copied the tests from the <code>bluepill_test</code> cookbook into place.</p>

<p><code>

</code></p>

<p>Recall from the <a href="/blog/2013/03/19/anatomy-of-a-test-kitchen-1-dot-0-cookbook-part-1/">previous post</a> that the <code>bluepill_test</code> recipe includes
the <code>bluepill</code> recipe. This is the basic setup of bluepill.</p>

<p><code>
INFO: Processing package[nc] action install (bluepill_test::default line 4)

INFO: link[/etc/init.d/test_app] created
INFO: Chef Run complete in 81.099185824 seconds
</code></p>

<p>And this is the rest of the <code>bluepill_test</code> recipe. It sets up a test
service that will basically be a netcat process listening on a port.
Let&rsquo;s take a moment here and discuss what we have.</p>

<p>First, we have successfully converged the default recipe in the
<code>bluepill</code> cookbook via its inclusion in <code>bluepill_test</code>. This is
awesome, because we know the recipe works exactly as we defined it,
since Chef resources are declarative, and Chef exits if there&rsquo;s a
problem.</p>

<p>Second, we have successfully setup a service managed by bluepill
itself using the LWRP included in the <code>bluepill</code> cookbook,
<code>bluepill_service</code>. This means we know that the underlying provider
configured all the resources correctly.</p>

<p>At this point, we could say &ldquo;Ship it!&rdquo; and release the cookbook,
knowing it will do what we require. However, this may be disingenuous
because we don&rsquo;t know if the behavior of the system after all this
runs is actually correct. Therefore we look to the next segment of
output from Chef, from minitest:</p>

<p><code>
INFO: Running report handlers

Finished tests in 3.746002s, 1.6017 tests/s, 1.8687 assertions/s.
6 tests, 7 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips
</code></p>

<p>This is performed by the minitest-handler, which runs the tests copied
from the <code>bluepill_test</code> cookbook before. It&rsquo;s outside the scope of
this post to describe how to write minitest-chef tests, but we can
talk about the output.</p>

<p>We have 6 separate tests that perform 7 assertions, and they all
passed. The tests are asserting:</p>

<ol>
<li>The log file is created, and by the full name of the test, this is
to check for a regression from
<a href="http://tickets.opscode.com/browse/COOK-1295">COOK-1295</a>.</li>
<li>The <code>.pill</code> config file for the service must exist and be valid
Ruby.</li>
<li>The bluepill service must actually be enabled and running, thereby
testing that those actions in the LWRP work.</li>
<li>The running service, which listens on a TCP port, must be up and
available, thereby testing that bluepill started the service
correctly.</li>
</ol>


<p><code>

</code></p>

<p>This output shows Test Kitchen cleaning up after itself. We destroy
the Vagrant instance on a successful convergence and test run in Chef,
because further investigation is not required. If the test failed for
some reason, Test Kitchen leaves it running so you can log into the
machine and poke around to find out what went wrong. Then simply
correct the required part of the cookbook (recipes, tests, etc) and
rerun Test Kitchen. For example:</p>

<p><code>
% bundle exec kitchen login 1204
vagrant@ubuntu-1204$ ... run some commands
vagrant@ubuntu-1204$ ^D
% bundle exec kitchen converge 1204
</code></p>

<p>My goal with these posts is to get some information out for folks to
consider when examining Test Kitchen 1.0 alpha for their own projects.
There&rsquo;s a lot more to Test Kitchen, such as managing non-cookbook
projects, or even using other kinds of tests. We&rsquo;ll have more
documentation and guides as we get the 1.0 release out.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll assume the reader is familiar with basic components of cookbooks
like &ldquo;recipes,&rdquo; &ldquo;templates,&rdquo; and the top-level documentation files, so
let&rsquo;s trim this down to just the areas of concern for Test Kitchen.</p>

<p>```

├── Berksfile
└── test</p>

</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>Note that this cookbook has a &ldquo;test&rdquo; cookbook. I&rsquo;ll get to that in a
minute.</p>

<p>First of all, we have the <code>.kitchen.yml</code>. This is the project
definition that describes what is required to run test kitchen itself.
This particular file tells Test Kitchen to bring up nodes of the
platforms we&rsquo;re testing with Vagrant, and defines the boxes with their
box names and URLs to download. You can view the full
<a href="https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/bluepill/blob/master/.kitchen.yml"><code>.kitchen.yml</code> in the Git repo</a>.
For now, I&rsquo;m going to focus on the <code>suite</code> stanza in the
<code>.kitchen.yml</code>. This defines how Chef will run when Test Kitchen
brings up the Vagrant machine.</p>

<p><code>yaml
- name: default
  run_list:
  - recipe[minitest-handler]
  - recipe[bluepill_test]
  attributes: {bluepill: { bin: "/opt/chef/embedded/bin/bluepill" } }
</code></p>

<p>Each platform has a recipe it will run with, in this case <code>apt</code> and
<code>yum</code>. Then the suite&rsquo;s run list is appended, so for example, the final run list of
the Ubuntu 12.04 node will be:</p>

<p><code>
["recipe[apt]", "recipe[minitest-handler]", "recipe[bluepill_test]"]
</code></p>

<p>We have apt so the apt cache on the node is updated before Chef does
anything else. This is pretty typical so we put it in the default run
list of each Ubuntu box.</p>

<p>The <code>minitest-handler</code> recipe existing in the run list means that the
Minitest Chef Handler will be run at the end of the Chef run. In this
case, it will use the tests from the test cookbook, <code>bluepill_test</code>.</p>

<p>The bluepill cookbook itself does not depend on any of these
cookbooks. So how does Test Kitchen know where to get them? Enter the
next file in the list above, <code>Berksfile</code>. This informs
<a href="http://berkshelf.com">Berkshelf</a> which cookbooks to download. The
relevant excerpt from the Berksfile is:</p>

<p><code>ruby
cookbook "apt"
cookbook "yum"
cookbook "minitest-handler"
cookbook "bluepill_test", :path =&gt; "./test/cookbooks/bluepill_test"
</code></p>

<p>Based on the
<a href="https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/bluepill/blob/master/Berksfile">Berksfile</a>,
it will download apt, yum, and minitest-handler from the Chef
Community site. It will also use the
<a href="https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/bluepill/tree/master/test/cookbooks/bluepill_test">bluepill_test</a>
included in the bluepill cookbook. This is transparent to the user, as
I&rsquo;ll cover in a moment.</p>

<p>Test Kitchen&rsquo;s Vagrant driver plugin handles all the configuration of
Vagrant itself based on the entries in the <code>.kitchen.yml</code>. To get the
Berkshelf integration in the Vagrant boxes, we need to install the
vagrant-berkshelf plugin in Vagrant. Then, we automatically get
Berkshelf&rsquo;s Vagrant integration, meaning all the cookbooks defined in
the Berksfile are going to be available on the box we bring up.</p>

<p>Remember the test cookbook mentioned above? It&rsquo;s the next component.
The default <code>suite</code> in <code>.kitchen.yml</code> puts <code>bluepill_test</code> in the run
list. This particular recipe will include the <code>bluepill</code> default
recipe, then it sets up a test service using the <code>bluepill_service</code>
LWRP. This means that when the nodes brought up by Test Kitchen via
Vagrant converge, they&rsquo;ll have bluepill installed and set up, and then
a service running that we can test the final behavior. Since Chef will
exit with a non-zero return code if it encounters an exception, we
know that a successful run means everything is configured as defined
in the recipes, and we can run tests against the node.</p>

<p>The tests we&rsquo;ll run are written with the
<a href="https://github.com/calavera/minitest-chef-handler/">Minitest Chef Handler</a>.
These are defined in the test cookbook, <code>files/default/tests/minitest</code>
directory. The <code>minitest-handler</code> cookbook (also in the default suite
run list) will execute the
<a href="https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/bluepill/blob/master/test/cookbooks/bluepill_test/files/default/tests/minitest/default_test.rb">default_test</a>
tests.</p>

<p>In the next post, we&rsquo;ll look at how to run Test Kitchen, and what all
the output means.</p>
