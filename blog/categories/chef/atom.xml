    <id>http://jtimberman.housepub.org/blog/2015/03/25/missing-transitive-dependencies</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of my home projects while I&rsquo;m on vacation this week is rebuilding my server with Fedora 21 (<a href="https://getfedora.org/en/server/">Server</a>). In order to do this, I needed to <a href="https://github.com/hw-cookbooks/runit/commit/c3d46bcf2c330e90aff8f1bb1e1701d57078cca8">add Fedora support</a> to the <a href="https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/runit">runit</a> cookbook, since I use runit for a number of services on my system. That&rsquo;s really neither here nor there, as the topic of this blog post isn&rsquo;t specific to Fedora, nor runit.</p>

<p>The topic is actually about an issue with transitive dependencies and how Chef dependency resolution works.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the scenario:</p>

<ol>
<li>I run chef on my node</li>
<li>The runit cookbook is synchronized</li>
<li>An older version of the runit cookbook is downloaded</li>
<li>The new changes I expected were not made</li>
<li>WTFs ensue</li>
</ol>


<p>So what happened?</p>

<p>The runit cookbook itself is updated to use Ian Meyer&rsquo;s Package Cloud repository &ndash; at least, the version I want to use is, which is on GitHub. When I submitted the PR for adding this repository for RHEL platforms, Ian had not yet added Fedora packages. That&rsquo;s okay because Fedora is not listed as supported in the cookbook. However, I wanted to use it, and figured folks in the community using Fedora Server might benefit too.</p>

<p>I digress. Ian pushed a Fedora package earlier today, so I added &ldquo;fedora&rdquo; to the various platform family conditionals, in the cookbook and opened the PR linked earlier. All was well in test kitchen. So I change my local repository&rsquo;s Berksfile:</p>

<p><code>ruby
cookbook 'runit', github: 'hw-cookbooks/runit', ref: 'jtimberman/fedora-21'
</code></p>

<p>Then a quick <code>berks update runit</code> and <code>berks upload runit</code>, and I was in business.</p>

<p>Or so I thought. Enter scenario listed above. The problem is, that when I did the <code>berks upload</code>, it only uploaded <code>runit</code>. However in the latest <code>runit</code> cookbook from that branch, it also adds a dependency on Computology&rsquo;s <a href="https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/packagecloud">packagecloud</a> cookbook, since it uses that to add the repository. When the <code>runit</code> cookbook is specified on the <code>berks upload</code> command, it doesn&rsquo;t upload the transitive dependencies when the location is a git URI. This appears to be by design.</p>

<p>What happens in Chef is that the server solves the graph, seeing that the node needs the runit cookbook. But the latest version of the runit cookbook depends on packagecloud, which hasn&rsquo;t yet been uploaded. So the dependency solver looks for the latest version of the runit cookbook that meets the constraint (none), and doesn&rsquo;t have the packagecloud cookbook. Thus, I end up with runit version 1.5.18 on my node, but it fails to converge because it doesn&rsquo;t have the changes required for Fedora, which are in 1.5.20.</p>

<p>The simple solution here is to upload the packagecloud cookbook. This can be done with <code>berks upload packagecloud</code>, as it does exist in the Berksfile.lock and has been cached in the berkshelf. Alternatively, <code>berks upload</code> will also upload the cookbook, as that operates on all cookbooks in  the Berksfile.lock.</p>

<p>I hope this helps anyone who&rsquo;s faced this issue with transitive dependencies when working on a cookbook &ldquo;in development.&rdquo;</p>

    <link href="http://jtimberman.housepub.org/blog/2015/03/20/chef-gem-compile-time-compatibility/"/>
    <updated>2015-03-20T08:46:47-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://jtimberman.housepub.org/blog/2015/03/20/chef-gem-compile-time-compatibility</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>TL;DR, if you&rsquo;re using Chef 11 and <code>chef-sugar</code>, upgrade <code>chef-sugar</code> to version 3.0.1. If you cannot upgrade, use the following in your <code>chef_gem</code> resources in your recipes:</p>

<p><code>ruby
compile_time true if Chef::Resource::ChefGem.instance_methods(false).include?(:compile_time)
</code></p>

<p>As you may be aware, <a href="https://www.chef.io/blog/2015/03/03/chef-12-1-0-released/">Chef 12.1.0</a> introduces a change to the <code>chef_gem</code> resource that prints out warning messages like this:</p>

<pre><code>WARN: chef_gem[chef-vault] chef_gem compile_time installation is deprecated
WARN: chef_gem[chef-vault] Please set `compile_time false` on the resource to use the new behavior.
WARN: chef_gem[chef-vault] or set `compile_time true` on the resource if compile_time behavior is required.
</code></pre>

<p>These messages are just warnings, but if you&rsquo;re installing a lot of gems in your recipes, you may be annoyed by the output. As the warning indicates, you can set <code>compile_time true</code> property. This doesn&rsquo;t work on versions of Chef before 12.1, though:</p>

<pre><code>NoMethodError: undefined method `compile_time' for Chef::Resource::ChefGem
</code></pre>

<p>So, as a workaround, we can ask whether we respond to the <code>compile_time</code> method in the <code>chef_gem</code> resource:</p>

<p><code>ruby
chef_gem 'chef-vault' do
  compile_time false if respond_to?(:compile_time)
end
</code></p>

<p>This appears to get around the problem for most cases. However, if you&rsquo;re using <code>chef-sugar</code>, you&rsquo;ll note that until version 3.0.0, <code>chef-sugar</code> includes a <code>compile_time</code> DSL method that gets injected into <code>Chef::Resource</code> (and <code>Chef::Recipe</code>). This has been modified to <code>at_compile_time</code> in <code>chef-sugar</code> version 3.0.0 to work around Chef&rsquo;s introduction of a <code>compile_time</code> method in the <code>chef_gem</code> resource. The simple thing to do is make sure that your <code>chef-sugar</code> gem/cookbook are updated to v3.0.1. However if that isn&rsquo;t an option for some reason, you can use this conditional check:</p>

<p><code>ruby
chef_gem 'chef-vault' do
  compile_time true if Chef::Resource::ChefGem.instance_methods(false).include?(:compile_time)
end
</code></p>

<p>Hat tip to Anthony Scalisi, who added this in <a href="https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/aws/pull/110">a pull request for the aws cookbook</a>. The <code>instance_methods</code> method comes from Ruby&rsquo;s <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.1/Module.html#method-i-instance_methods">Module class</a>. Per the documentation:</p>

<blockquote><p>Returns an array containing the names of the public and protected instance methods in the receiver. For a module, these are the public and protected methods; for a class, they are the instance (not singleton) methods. If the optional parameter is false, the methods of any ancestors are not included.</p></blockquote>

<p>If we look at this in, e.g., <code>chef-shell</code> under Chef 12.1.0:</p>

<p><code>
chef:recipe &gt; Chef::Resource::ChefGem.instance_methods(false)
 =&gt; [:gem_binary, :compile_time, :after_created]
</code></p>

<p>And in Chef 12.0.3 or 11.18.6:</p>

<p><code>
chef &gt; Chef::Resource::ChefGem.instance_methods(false)
 =&gt; [:gem_binary, :after_created]
</code></p>

    <link href="http://jtimberman.housepub.org/blog/2015/02/09/quick-tip-create-a-provisioner-node/"/>
    <updated>2015-02-09T20:50:12-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://jtimberman.housepub.org/blog/2015/02/09/quick-tip-create-a-provisioner-node</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This quick tip is brought to you by my preparation for my ChefConf talk about using Chef Provisioning to build a Chef Server Cluster, which is based on my blog post about the same. In the blog post I used chef-zero as my Chef Server, but for the talk I&rsquo;m using Hosted Chef.</p>

<p>In order for the Chef Provisioning recipe to work the provisioning node &ndash; the node that runs chef-client &ndash; needs to have the appropriate permissions to manage objects on the Chef Server. This is easy with chef-zero &ndash; there are no ACLs at all. However in Hosted Chef, like any regular Chef Server, the ACLs don&rsquo;t allow nodes' API clients to modify other nodes, or API clients.</p>

<p>Fortunately we can do all the work necessary using knife, with the <a href="https://github.com/chef/knife-acl">knife-acl</a> plugin. In this quick tip, I&rsquo;ll create a group for provisioning nodes, and give that group the proper permissions for the Chef Provisioning recipe to create the machines' nodes and clients.</p>

<p>First of all, I&rsquo;m using ChefDK, and it&rsquo;s my Ruby environment too, so install the gem:</p>

<p><code>sh
chef gem install knife-acl
</code></p>

<p>Next, use the <code>knife group</code> subcommand to create the new group. Groups are a number of users and/or API clients. By default, an organization on Hosted Chef will have <code>admins</code>, <code>billing-admins</code>, <code>clients</code>, and <code>users</code>. Let&rsquo;s create <code>provisioners</code> now.</p>

<p><code>sh
knife group create provisioners
</code></p>

<p>The Role-based access control (RBAC) system in the Chef Server allows us to assign read, create, update, grant, and delete permissions to various objects in the organization. Containers are a special holder of other types of objects, in this case we need to add permissions for the clients and nodes containers. This is what allows the Chef Provisioning recipe&rsquo;s <code>machine</code> resources to have their Chef objects created.</p>

<p>```sh
for i in read create update grant delete
do
  knife acl add containers clients $i group provisioners
done</p>

<p>for i in read create update grant delete
do
  knife acl add containers nodes $i group provisioners
done
```</p>

<p>Next, we need the API client that will be used by the Chef Provisioning node to authenticate with the Chef Server, and the node needs to be created as well. By default the client will automatically have permissions for the node object that has the same name.</p>

<p><code>sh
knife client create -d chefconf-provisioner &gt; ~/.chef/chefconf-provisioner.pem
knife node create -d chefconf-provisioner
</code></p>

<p>Finally, we need to put the new API client into the provisioners group that was created earlier. First we need to get a mapping of the actors in the organization. Then we can add the client to the group.</p>

<p><code>sh
knife actor map
knife group add actor provisioners chefconf-provisioner
</code></p>

<p>The <code>knife actor map</code> command will generate a YAML file like this:</p>

<h2>```yaml</h2>

<p>:user_map:
  :users:</p>

<pre><code>jtimberman: 12345678901234567890123456780123
</code></pre>

<p>  :usags:</p>

<pre><code>12345678901234567890123456780123: jtimberman
</code></pre>

<p>:clients:
  chefconf-provisioner: chefconf-provisioner
  jtimberman-chefconf-validator: jtimberman-chefconf-validator
```</p>

<p>This maps users to their USAG and stores a list of clients. More information about this is in the <a href="https://github.com/chef/knife-acl/blob/master/README.md">knife-acl README</a></p>

<p>At this point, we have a node, with the private key in <code>~/.chef</code> that can be used with the Chef Server to use Chef Provisioning&rsquo;s <code>machine</code> resource. We can also perform additional tasks that require having a node object, such as create secrets as Chef Vault items:</p>

<p><code>sh
knife vault create secrets dnsimple -M client -J data_bags/secrets/dnsimple.json -A jtimberman -S 'name:chefconf-provisioner'
</code></p>

<p>The entire series of commands is below.</p>

<p>```sh
chef gem install knife-acl
knife group create provisioners</p>

<p>for i in read create update grant delete
do
  knife acl add containers clients $i group provisioners
done</p>

<p>for i in read create update grant delete
do
  knife acl add containers nodes $i group provisioners
done</p>

<p>knife client create -d chefconf-provisioner > ~/.chef/chefconf-provisioner.pem
knife node create -d chefconf-provisioner
knife actor map
knife group add actor provisioners chefconf-provisioner</p>

<p>knife vault create secrets dnsimple -M client -J data_bags/secrets/dnsimple.json -A jtimberman -S &lsquo;name:chefconf-provisioner&rsquo;
```</p>

<p>Hopefully this helps you out with your use of Chef Provisioning, and a non-zero Chef server. If you have further questions, find me at ChefConf!</p>

    <link href="http://jtimberman.housepub.org/blog/2015/01/17/quick-tip-define-resources-to-notifiy-in-lwrps/"/>
    <updated>2015-01-17T22:37:06-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://jtimberman.housepub.org/blog/2015/01/17/quick-tip-define-resources-to-notifiy-in-lwrps</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this quick tip, I&rsquo;ll explain why you may need to create resources to notify in a provider, even if the resource exists in a recipe, when using <code>use_inline_resources</code> in Chef&rsquo;s <a href="http://docs.chef.io/lwrp.html">LWRP DSL</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll use an example cookbook, <code>notif</code>, to illustrate. First, I&rsquo;ve created <code>cookbooks/notif/resources/default.rb</code>, with the following content.</p>

<p><code>ruby
actions :write
default_action :write
</code></p>

<p>Then, I have written <code>cookbooks/notif/providers/default.rb</code> like this:</p>

<p>```ruby
use_inline_resources</p>

<p>action :write do
  log &lsquo;notifer&rsquo; do</p>

<pre><code>notifies :create, 'file[notified]'
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>Then the default recipe, where I&rsquo;ll use the resource automatically generated from the resource directory, <code>notif</code>.</p>

<p>```ruby
file &lsquo;notified&rsquo; do
  content &lsquo;something&rsquo;
  action :nothing
end</p>

<p>notif &lsquo;doer&rsquo;
```</p>

<p>When I run Chef, I&rsquo;ll get an error like this:</p>

<p>```
 Recipe: notif::default
   * file[notified] action nothing (skipped due to action :nothing)
   * notif[doer] action write</p>

<pre><code> ================================================================================
 Error executing action `write` on resource 'notif[doer]'
 ================================================================================

 Chef::Exceptions::ResourceNotFound
 ----------------------------------
 resource log[notifer] is configured to notify resource file[notified] with action create, but file[notified] cannot be found in the resource collection. log[notifer] is defined in /tmp/kitchen/cookbooks/notif/providers/default.rb:4:in `block in class_from_file'

 Resource Declaration:
 ---------------------
 # In /tmp/kitchen/cookbooks/notif/recipes/default.rb

  12: notif 'doer'

 Compiled Resource:

<hr />

<pre><code> # Declared in /tmp/kitchen/cookbooks/notif/recipes/default.rb:12:in `from_file'

 notif("doer") do
   action :write
   retries 0
   retry_delay 2
   default_guard_interpreter :default
   declared_type :notif

   recipe_name "default"
 end
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>To fix this, I define the <code>file</code> resource in the provider:</p>

<p>```ruby
use_inline_resources</p>

<p>action :write do
  log &lsquo;notifer&rsquo; do</p>

<pre><code>notifies :create, 'file[notified]'
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  file &lsquo;notified&rsquo; do</p>

<pre><code>content new_resource.name
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>Then when I run Chef, it will converge and notify the file resource to be configured.</p>

<p>```
Recipe: notif::default
  * file[notified] action nothing (skipped due to action :nothing)
  * notif[doer] action write</p>

<pre><code>* log[notifer] action write

* file[notified] action create

<p>Running handlers:

Chef Client finished, &frac34; resources updated in 1.298990565 seconds
```</p>

<h2>Why does this happen?</h2>

<p>The reason for this is because <code>use_inline_resources</code> tells Chef that in this provider, we&rsquo;re using inline resources that will be added to their own run context, with their own resource collection. We don&rsquo;t have access to the resource collection from the recipe. Even though the <code>file[notified]</code> resource exists from the recipe, it doesn&rsquo;t actually get inherited in the provider&rsquo;s run context, raising the error we saw before.</p>

<p>We can turn off <code>use_inline_resources</code> by removing it, and the custom resource will be configured:</p>

<p>```ruby
action :write do
  log &lsquo;notifer&rsquo; do</p>

<pre><code>notifies :create, 'file[notified]'
</code></pre>

<p>  end
end
```</p>

<p>Then run Chef:</p>

<p>```
Recipe: notif::default
  * file[notified] action nothing (skipped due to action :nothing)
  * notif[doer] action write (up to date)

<p>```</p>

<p>Notice that the <code>file[notified]</code> resource wasn&rsquo;t updated at the start of the run, when it was encountered in the recipe, but it was when notified by the log resource in the provider action, changing the content.</p>

<h2>Use inline compile mode!</h2>

<p>The <code>use_inline_resources</code> method in the lightweight provider DSL is strongly recommended. It makes it easier to send notifications from the custom resource itself to other resources in the recipe&rsquo;s resource collection. Read more about the <a href="http://docs.chef.io/lwrp.html#inline-compile-mode">inline compile mode</a> in the Chef docs.</p>

<p>Also, define the resources that you need to notify when you&rsquo;re doing this in your provider&rsquo;s actions. A common example is within a provider that writes configuration for a service, and needs to tell that service to restart.</p>

    <link href="http://jtimberman.housepub.org/blog/2015/01/12/quick-tip-testing-conditionals-in-chefspec/"/>
    <updated>2015-01-12T14:07:06-07:00</updated>
    <id>http://jtimberman.housepub.org/blog/2015/01/12/quick-tip-testing-conditionals-in-chefspec</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This tip is brought to you by the <a href="https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks/homebrew">homebrew</a> cookbook.</p>

<p><a href="http://sethvargo.github.io/chefspec/">ChefSpec</a> is a great way to create tests for Chef recipes to catch regressions. Sometimes recipes end up having branching conditional logic that can have very different outcomes based on external factors &ndash; attributes, existing system state, or cross-platform support.</p>

<p>The homebrew cookbook only supports OS X, so we don&rsquo;t have cross-platform support to test there. However, its default recipe has four conditionals to test. You can read the entire <a href="https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/homebrew/blob/master/spec/recipes/default_spec.rb">default_spec.rb</a> for full context, I&rsquo;m going to focus on just one aspect here:</p>

<ul>
<li>Installing homebrew should only happen if the <code>brew</code> binary does not exist.</li>
</ul>


<p>This is a common use case in Chef recipes. The best way to go about converging your node to the desired state involves running some arbitrary command. In this case, it&rsquo;s the installation of Homebrew itself. Normally for installations we want to use an idempotent, convergent resource like <code>package</code>. However, since homebrew is to be our package management system, we have to do something else. As it turns out the homebrew project provides an installation script and that script will install a binary, <code>/usr/local/bin/brew</code>. We will assume that if Chef converged on a node after running the script, and the <code>brew</code> binary exists, then we don&rsquo;t need to attempt reinstallation. There&rsquo;s more robust ways to go about it (e.g., running <code>brew</code> gives some desired output), but this works for example purposes today.</p>

<p>From <a href="https://github.com/opscode-cookbooks/homebrew/blob/master/recipes/default.rb">the recipe</a>, here&rsquo;s the resource:</p>

<p><code>ruby
execute 'install homebrew' do
  command homebrew_go
  user node['homebrew']['owner'] || homebrew_owner
  not_if { ::File.exist? '/usr/local/bin/brew' }
end
</code></p>

<p><code>command</code> is a script, called <code>homebrew_go</code>, which is a local variable set to a path in <code>Chef::Config[:file_cache_path]</code>. It is retrieved in the recipe with <code>remote_file</code>. The resource used to have <code>execute homebrew_go</code>, but when ChefSpec runs, it does so in a random temporary directory, which we cannot predict the name.</p>

<p>The astute observer will note that the <code>user</code> parameter has another conditional (designated by the <code>||</code>). That&rsquo;s actually the subject of another post. In this post, I&rsquo;m concerned only with testing the guard, <code>not_if</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>not_if</code> is a Ruby block, which means the Ruby code is evaluated inline during the Chef run. How we go about testing that is the subject of this post.</p>

<p>First, we need to mock the return result of sending the <code>#exist?</code> method to the <code>File</code> class. There are two reasons. First, we want to control the conditional so we can write a test for each outcome. Second, someone running the test (like me) might have already installed homebrew on their local system (which I have), and so <code>/usr/local/bin/brew</code> will exist. To do this, in our context, we have a <code>before</code> block that stubs the return to false:</p>

<p><code>ruby
before(:each) do
  allow_any_instance_of(Chef::Resource).to receive(:homebrew_owner).and_return('vagrant')
  allow_any_instance_of(Chef::Recipe).to receive(:homebrew_owner).and_return('vagrant')
  allow(File).to receive(:exist?).and_return(false)
  stub_command('which git').and_return(true)
end
</code></p>

<p>There&rsquo;s some other mocked values here. I&rsquo;ll talk about the <code>vagrant</code> user for <code>homebrew_owner</code> in a moment, though again, that&rsquo;s the subject of another post.</p>

<p>The actual spec will test that the installation script will actually get executed when we run chef, and as the <code>vagrant</code> user.</p>

<p>```ruby
it &lsquo;runs homebrew installation as the default user&rsquo; do
  expect(chef_run).to run_execute(&lsquo;install homebrew&rsquo;).with(</p>

<pre><code>:user =&gt; 'vagrant'
</code></pre>

<p>  )
end
```</p>

<p>When rspec runs, we see this is the case:</p>

<p>```
homebrew::default
  default user</p>

<pre><code>runs homebrew installation as the default user
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>If I didn&rsquo;t mock the user, it would be <code>jtimberman</code>, as that is the user that is running Chef via rspec/ChefSpec. The test would fail. If you&rsquo;re looking at the full file, there&rsquo;s some other details we&rsquo;re going to look at shortly. If I didn&rsquo;t mock the return for <code>File.exist?</code>, the execute wouldn&rsquo;t run at all.</p>

<p>To test what happens when <code>/usr/local/bin/brew</code> exists, I set up a new context in rspec, and create a new <code>before</code> block.</p>

<p>```ruby
context &lsquo;/usr/local/bin/brew exists&rsquo; do
  before(:each) do</p>

<pre><code>allow(File).to receive(:exist?).and_return(true)
stub_command('which git').and_return(true)
</code></pre>

<p>  end</p>

<p>  it &lsquo;does not run homebrew installation&rsquo; do</p>

<pre><code>expect(chef_run).to_not run_execute('install homebrew')
</code></pre>

<p>  end

<p>We don&rsquo;t need the <code>vagrant</code> mocks earlier, but we do need to stub <code>File.exist?</code>. This test would pass on my system without it, but not on, e.g., a Linux system that doesn&rsquo;t have homebrew.</p>

<p>Then running rspec, we see:</p>

<p>```
homebrew::default
  /usr/local/bin/brew exists</p>

<pre><code>does not run homebrew installation
</code></pre>

<p>  default user</p>

<pre><code>runs homebrew installation as the default user
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>In a coming post, I will walk through the conditionals related to the <code>homebrew_owner</code>.</p>
